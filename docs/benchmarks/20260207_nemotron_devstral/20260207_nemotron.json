      "prompt": "Summarize the following in exactly 3 bullet points:\n\nThe transformer architecture, introduced in the 2017 paper 'Attention Is All You Need' by Vaswani et al., revolutionized natural language processing. It replaced recurrent neural networks with self-attention mechanisms, allowing parallel processing of sequences. The key innovation was the multi-head attention mechanism that lets the model focus on different parts of the input simultaneously. Transformers enabled models like BERT, GPT, and T5 that achieved state-of-the-art results across NLP tasks. The architecture's scalability led to the development of large language models with billions of parameters.",

      "response": "Think of a Docker container like a **shipping container for software**. Just as a metal box protects goods, keeps them from the weather, and can be stacked on a ship regardless of what’s inside, a Docker container wraps an application (and everything it needs to run) in a self‑contained “box.”  \n\n- **Isolation:** The app runs in its own environment, separate from other programs on the same computer, so they don’t interfere.  \n- **Portability:** The container image can be moved to any computer or cloud that supports Docker and will work the same way—no “it works on my machine” problems.  \n- **Efficiency:** Multiple containers can share the same operating system kernel, so they start quickly and use far less memory than full virtual machines.  \n\nIn short, Docker containers let developers package, ship, and run software reliably anywhere, just like standardized shipping containers move goods across the globe.",
